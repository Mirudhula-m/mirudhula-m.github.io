**Research Intern**<br>
*Cognition Lab, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India*

* Worked with multiple PhD students to conduct experimental tasks and decode EEG signal data.
* Pioneered the use of web-based experiments to remotely conduct experiments during COVID-19.
* Worked on my undergraduate thesis titled "Selection in Visual Working Memory due to Exogenous Visuospatial Attention", by employing a 4-AFC task.


<span style="color:gray">June 2018 - August 2018</span><br>
**Software Developer, Intern**<br>
*CGI, Bangalore, India*

* Developed a spelling corrector for a ChatBoth platform using LSTM recurrent neural networks.
* Employed sequence-to-sequence and character-based encoder-decoder model.


## **Projects**

**[A single cell RNA-seq based aging clock for human neurons](../assets/project_reports/predict_age_report.pdf)**<br>
*Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA*

* Identifying key gene expression representations for efficient prediction of patient age.
* Implementing Multi-layer Perceptron with Variational Autoencoder for dimensionality reduction using Pytorch.
* This is a team project with three members, where the other two are responsible for implementing Non-negative Matrix Factorization and De-noising Autoencoders for the same data.


<span style="color:gray">October 2022 - Present</span><br>
**[Common Signatures between Severe Asthma and Lung Cancer](../assets/project_reports/signatures.pdf)**<br>
*Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA*

* Implementing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis on data from GEO, to identify common signatures.
* Validating results by classifying a separate lung cancer dataset using Decision Trees.

**[Simulating sequence evolution for in-silico experimentation](../assets/project_reports/simulations.pdf)**<br>
*Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA*

* Developing a simulation of bacterial transcription, translation, fitness, selection and mutation.
* This is a team project with five members, each responsible for one of the five steps mentioned above.
* Responsible for the mutation step, where a mutation is programmatically induced at random positions, sampled from a uniform distribution.
* Responsible for an extended study where mutation rates are optimized according to changes in fitness of bacteria.


<span style="color:gray">February 2022 - March 2022</span><br>
**[Classification of Glioma](../assets/project_reports/glioma.pdf)**<br>
